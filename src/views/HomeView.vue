        This repository is the code for my recipe website. I mostly use it for
        the opportunity to play around with CICD and domain stuff. I also use it
        when I forget what I was doing in the middle of the grocery store, and
        to send friends recipes I use. The food here is pretty good. I call it
        Birchwood because I lived in a birch wood for several years and really
        fell in love with it. Originally this was a series of microservices (see
        <a href="https://github.com/brandonapol/Birchwood">Birchwood</a>),
      </p>

        but I didn't feel like paying for an EKS cluster after I finished
        standing it up. Since birch trees are a colony organism (what we see as
        'trees' are the above-ground portions of a larger entity connected by
        roots) it made sense both for the Birch woods to reflect who I am as
        well as a natural representation of microservices connected by a service
        mesh. But I wanted something cheap and automatic and to figure out the
        hackiest way possible to basically do the same thing, so here we are.
        Enjoy!
