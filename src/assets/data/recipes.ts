    ],
    instructions: [
      "1. Prepare the Mascarpone Mixture: In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar.",
      "2. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (double boiler) and whisk constantly for about 5 minutes until the mixture thickens slightly. Remove from heat and let cool.",
      "3. In a separate bowl, beat the heavy whipping cream until stiff peaks form.",
      "4. Gently fold the mascarpone cheese into the egg mixture until smooth. Then, fold in the whipped cream until fully combined.",
      "5. Prepare the Coffee Dip: Mix the cold brew with vanilla extract in a shallow dish.",

      "7. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers.",
      "8. Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers, then spread the remaining mascarpone mixture on top.",

    ],
    notes: [
      "This recipe makes a 9x13-inch tiramisu, serving 12-15 people.",
      "Use concentrated cold brew (1:2 ratio) for a stronger coffee flavor.",
      "Ladyfingers should be dipped quickly to avoid oversaturation.",
      "For an alcoholic version, replace 1/2 cup of the cold brew with 1/2 cup coffee liqueur (like Kahlúa or Tia Maria) or 1/4 cup dark rum.",
      "For an extra decadent texture, chill overnight before serving."

    title: "Beet Salad with Goat Cheese and Walnuts",
    ingredients: [
      "4 medium-sized beets, scrubbed, roasted, peeled, and diced",
      "1/3 cup goat cheese, crumbled", 
      "1/4 cup walnuts, toasted and roughly chopped",
      "2 cups fresh mixed greens (such as arugula, spinach, or baby kale)",
      "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar",
      "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil",

      "Fresh dill or parsley, for garnish"
    ],
    instructions: [
      "1. Prepare the Beets: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Wrap the beets in aluminum foil and roast them in the preheated oven for about 50-60 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Once cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and dice the beets into bite-sized pieces.",

      "3. Assemble the Salad: In a large bowl, toss the mixed greens with half of the dressing to lightly coat. Arrange the dressed greens on a serving platter or in a salad bowl. Scatter the diced beets over the greens, followed by the crumbled goat cheese and toasted walnuts.", 
      "4. Finish and Serve: Drizzle the remaining dressing over the salad. Garnish with fresh dill or parsley for an extra touch of freshness. Give a final sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste, if needed."
