            "3. Slice the avocados. Sometimes I just mash them. Doesn't really matter other than aesthetics.",
            "4. The pork belly is hard to tell if it's cooked, so I usually just put it on medium heat for about fifteen minutes. If the edges start searing I know I'm in the right territory, just stir regularly so all sides cook.",
            "5. Serve on tacos. Beans are good for extra protein. Add cilantro, red onion, feta etc for visible flair."
